# 🚨 Quick Fix for "Entity Not Found" (NaN) Issue

## ✅ Good News!
The database is correct - Major owns **9 entities**.

## 🔍 The Problem
Your frontend is showing "No entities found" which causes the NaN error when clicking.

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE FIX** (Choose One):

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Fastest)
1. Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/entities**
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
3. This clears cache and forces reload

### Option 2: Clear Session & Re-login
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **"Clear site data"**
4. Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/login**
5. Log in as **Major**
6. Go to: **http://localhost:5173/entities**

### Option 3: Check if Logged In
1. Look at **top right corner** of the page
2. Do you see: **"Welcome, Major"**?
3. If NO → Go to http://localhost:5173/login and log in
4. If YES → Try Option 1 (hard refresh)

```

**What do you see?**

### If you see JSON with entities:

### If you see empty array `{"results": []}`:
❌ Session issue - log out and log in again
