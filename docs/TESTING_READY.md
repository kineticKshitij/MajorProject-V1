**How to test:**
1. Login as Major
2. See 9 entities ✅
3. NOT "No entities found" ❌

**Backend status:** ✅ Verified (Major owns 9 entities)  
**Frontend status:** ⏳ Needs manual verification

---

## 💡 Tips for Testing

### Do This ✅:
- Open browser console (F12) to check for errors
- Take screenshots of any issues
- Test one feature at a time
- Document results as you go
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) if things look cached

### Don't Do This ❌:
- Rush through tests
- Skip error checking
- Assume something works without testing
- Test without servers running
- Forget to document results

---

## 🚨 If You Find Issues

### For UUID/NaN Issues:
1. Check console for errors
2. Check URL format
3. Hard refresh browser
4. Report: "UUID still showing as NaN in [location]"

### For Entity Types Error:
1. Check console for "entityTypes.map"
2. Check Network tab for API response
3. Report: "Entity types not loading"

### For Execution Count Error:
1. Check backend console for AttributeError
2. Check if Google search opens
3. Report: "Dork execution failing with [error]"

### For Any Other Issue:
